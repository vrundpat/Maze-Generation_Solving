# Maze-Generation_Solving

A complex-maze generator using Recursive-Backtracking and modified version of the Randomized-Prims's Algrithm, accompanied by
an A* algorithm to solve the mazes efficiently. Both aspects (generation and solving are visualized using a pygame GUI). 

Run instructions:
- run main.py

Run time instructions:
- To solve the maze (from the top-left to the bottom right), press 's' during run time.
